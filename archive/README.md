# Archive

This folder stores assets or documents that are not required for Triplo's container builds or Web UI runtime. They are preserved here only for reference, and the folder is listed in `.gitignore` so future additions stay out of the main commit surface.

## Current contents

- `hero-test.webp` — an experimental hero image that is no longer referenced by any Dockerfile or Web UI asset pipeline. Archived to avoid bloating the repository until we decide whether to reuse it.
